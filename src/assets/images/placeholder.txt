This is a placeholder file to ensure the assets/images directory exists.

To complete the setup:
1. Save the Avicenna Enterprise Solutions screenshot as 'avicenna-screenshot.png' in this directory
2. The image will automatically be used in your Projects component

Recommended image formats:
- avicenna-screenshot.png (preferred)
- avicenna-screenshot.jpg (alternative)

The image should be approximately 400x250 pixels for best display.
